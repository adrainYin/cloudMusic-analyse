And I love you so
The people ask me how
How I've lived till now
I tell them I don't know
I guess they understand
How lonely life has been
But life began again
The day you took my hand
And yes I know
how lonely life can be
The shadows follow me
And the night won't set me free
But I don't let
the evening get me down
Now that you're around me
And you love me too
Your thoughts are just for me
You set my spirit free
I'm happy that you do
The book of life is brief
And once a page is read
All but love is dead
That is my believe
And yes I know
how lonely life can be
The shadows follow me
And the night won't set me free
But I don't let
The evening get me down
Now that you're around me
And I love you so
The people ask me how
How I've lived till now
I tell them I don't know
